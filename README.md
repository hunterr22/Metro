# Metropolitan Convention Center Event Registration App

This repository will hold multiple folders showing iterations as we build and add new features to produce a fully fledged event registration application.
For example, the first folder, `metro` holds the source code necessary to produce a simple RESTful API with basic CRUD functionality and hard coded data.

Some examples of feature functionalities we would like to add include: 
- integrated `h2/hsql` database to hold persistent state
- React.js frontend client
- containerized application using Docker
- Authentication via JWTs with appropriate filters on HTTP requests
- cluster management and load balancing with Kubernetes
- CI/CD management
